      <h2>Sponsorships</h2>
      <p>
        We're Emma Wedekind, Kelly Vaughn, and Ali Spittel - three seasoned
        software developers working in different sectors. We wanted to add our
        voices to the podcasting sphere and share our experiences and advice. We
        have great discussions around how to start coding, the hot technologies
        right now, how to get your first developer job, imposter syndrome, how
        to write CSS and more!
      </p>
      <p>
        Our podcast has been reaching a large audience of diverse developers
        from junior to senior and everything in between. According to Spotify's
        analytics, 35% of our listeners are women, far outpacing the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our podcast is new, but growing fast. We hit the 35,000 listens mark a
        month after our first episode. Our first episode has reached 8,000
        listens before it was four weeks old. Each episode is passing the 5k
        listens mark one week after publication. The growth has been enormous,
        and we expect these numbers to keep climbing rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our episodes are released first thing each Monday morning, and are about
        both technical topics and career advice for other developers.
      </p>
