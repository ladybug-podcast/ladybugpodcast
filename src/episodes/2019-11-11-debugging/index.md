Are you a developer looking for your next challenge? Meet Shopify. We’re on a mission to make commerce better for everyone - but we do things a bit differently. We don’t tell people how to solve problems - we give them the tools, trust, and autonomy to build new solutions. We don’t work alone - we leverage the diverse perspectives across our teams in everything we do. And we don’t have all the answers - we’re big enough to tackle problems at scale but small enough that we haven’t figured them all out. If you’re a builder at heart who wants to solve highly technical problems. If you want to take all of your life experiences and apply them to a blank canvas. Or if you want access to really powerful tools - Shopify is the place for you. Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shopify.com/careers">shopify.com/careers</a> today.

When’s the last time you worked on that side project you’re always thinking about? How much progress could you make if you had three months to work and learn in a room full of smart, friendly, intellectually curious programmers?

If you’re thinking: “I could make a lot of progress!” you should check out the Recurse Center.

The Recurse Center is like a writer’s retreat, but for programmers: There are no classes or teachers. You direct your own learning and time, and can explore what interests you in a supportive community of 1600 programmers from all over the world.

Whether you’ve been programming for six months or 30 years, RC is for you. Maybe you want to recreate vintage computer art, make contributions to Rust, learn CS best practices or start developing a new programming language? Those are all things people have done at RC!

You can attend a retreat in Brooklyn for one, six, or 12 weeks. RC is free for everyone, and offers living expense grants of up to \$7,000 to people from underrepresented groups. They have an integrated recruiting agency, and offer career support whether you’re looking for your first programming job or want to find a senior role at a great company.
