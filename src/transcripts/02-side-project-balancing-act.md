**Emma** [0:00] Today we're talking side projects. If you're not giving up several hours a day to work on your side projects, you're really not working hard enough. You shouldn't have time to sleep, eat, or even make friends.

**Kelly** [0:10] We're going to call this episode how to ignore everything Emma says.

**Emma** [0:14] Yeah, I'm just kidding. Finding time to work on side projects is super hard, especially when you're working a nine to five job, and especially when you have pets that are really needy, like we all do. So how the heck do you balance it all? Today, we're going to dive into the side projects that we're working on, and our tips and tricks for managing it all. So let's just jump right in.

**Kelly** [0:36] Welcome to the Ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly.

**Ali** [0:38] I'm Ali.

**Emma** [0:39] I'm Emma.

**Lindsey** [0:40] And I'm Lindsey and we're debugging the tech industry. So let's go ahead and get started in our projects and just talk about what our projects are. We can't really talk about side projects without actually mentioning what we do. So currently, my side projects are producing egghead.io videos, creating an egghead course with I'm sorry, Joel that I'm very behind on even though he's actually very chill about it. This podcast is one and my baby is my blog. So my blog A11y with Lindsey. I've been writing it for almost nine months now I think. Yeah, about nine months. And that's pretty much my biggest side project right now.

**Emma** [1:20] Can you explain why it's a-11-y too because some people might be confused.

**Lindsey** [1:24] Okay. There are 11 letters between the A and the y in the word accessibility

**Emma** [1:30] And in all honesty too, like just off the top of my head, it could help with dyslexia too...for people who have trouble spelling, you know, words or they mix up letters, I feel like that could help as well. Especially too, for people maybe who don't speak English natively. Like I have trouble spelling the word internationalization. So writing i-18-n is much easier.

**Lindsey** [1:48] Abbreviation just make things easier.

**Emma** [1:51] Why is abbreviation such a long word God!

**Kelly** [1:55] Speaking of abbreviation, let me talk about myself.

**Emma** [1:59] Hey, weasel your way in there. I see you.

**Kelly** [2:02] So my primary side project is running my business, which is also my full time job. Because what do you run a company, you never really get much of a break, because you're too busy doing the actual day to day work for running, in my case, running an agency. And so my side project is finding really cool new ways to automate things that I'm currently spending a lot of time doing manual work on. And how to make my employees life a little bit better as well. Other than that, I occasionally speak at conferences, and I'm going to be hosting a meetup pretty soon here in Atlanta, which I'm not going to go too much into detail about yet.

**Emma** [2:43] You're so busy so much.

**Ali** [2:47]All the things.

**Lindsey** [2:48] Awesome.

**Kelly** [2:49] Ali.

**Ali** [2:50]Yeah, so I work two jobs. So that's a lot of our time. I work full time at Dev and then I work part time teaching for general assembly and teaching is my real love. So I definitely have to do that. Even though adding on a second job is a lot of work. I also try to do office hours to mentor people because I feel bad that sometimes answering written communications isn't super fun for me. So rather meet people face to face. So I started doing those... pretty fun. And then the whole internet persona thing doing.. all the... all the online things like blogging and tweeting and all that. That's a lot of work to. And then my thing for code side projects is that I try to do really one-off stuff that I can crank out in a night or so. We can talk about this more later. But I essentially... if I can get something done really fast, I'm way more likely to actually follow through with it. So that's my strategy for code side projects.

**Kelly** [3:48] Emma's middle name is side project. So I cannot wait to hear.

**Emma** [3:52] It really is. it's Emma-side project-Wedekind. I'm just kidding. It's not at all. So I have a ton of things that I do and everyone knows as me how I managed it. And I'll tell you my secret is um... I don't feel like I manage any of it. Let's start. So like Lindsey, I am supposed to be making egghead.io courses. Yeah, it's unfortunately kind of falling through the cracks a little just because I have like higher priority things. But I have a couple of courses on egghead I really want to get back to making those. I was learning German for a while. I totally forgot this was a priority that I had. I moved to Germany and didn't speak it. Ich spreche Deutsch! But I was taking German classes for a while, and that took up a lot of my time. I started an open source project called coding coach, which is shameless plug. It allows mentors and mentees to connect all over the world. And it's done for free. So that's been pretty, pretty great. I blog a lot. I like to write things. I.... I have three podcasts. So I'm a panelist on JS Party, which is super fun. Highly recommend. This podcast is great, which you all would know because you're listening. And then my coworker and I, Khalel. He's awesome. Go follow him clueless shell. He and I are starting this podcast called lunch pod where we basically just record our lunchtime conversations talking about like life in tech, it's going to be pretty cool. So that's a lot of hearing myself on the internet. I also helped organize a meetup in Karlsruhe, Germany. And I speak at conferences because I like to hear myself talk. So that's my list. But let's talk about how we balance these things, right how we prioritize, time box, batch these things and like do bunch of like little things you can check off. So let's just jump into prioritizing. So like, what are your strategies? Let's go back to Lindsey since you kicked us off. What is... how do you prioritize what's important? And what's like the most timely?

**Lindsey** [4:12] Yeah, so this one is actually one that I think about a lot. So for example, the week before we launched this, my focus was mostly on this, like making sure I was getting the things that were "must haves" done. And timeliness is probably the biggest first thing I go to first with prioritization. Like, what needs to be done right now and what can wait. And the other one is also what do you actually want to do? Because there's a lot of side projects that you don't have to do. You think you have to but you really don't.

**Emma** [6:16] That's super true. Because I hear a lot of people like, how do I start a blog? And I'm like, well, first question is, do you want to blog because like, if you don't... it's not just like a... like when people go and they're like I want to buy, or I'm gonna adopt a dog. And then they adopted a dog. And they're like, I don't like dogs. It's like, don't start a blog if you don't like blogging, right? Like there's so many other things you can do like to pique your interest,

**Lindsey** [6:38] right.

**Kelly** [6:39] There's a very good reason why I do not have a blog. And it's because my ability to write for a long period of time kind of ends at like about 240 characters.

**Emma** [6:50] So Kelly, you're also in the process of barrel aging, the spaghetti you've owed me?

**Kelly** [6:54] It is a lot of work, but it's going to be delicious.

**Lindsey** [6:58] Yeah, so like, I was like actually talking to somebody yesterday about blogging, and he's like, "Oh, I should start one." And I'm like, "Well, do you want to?" Like if you don't want to, that's okay. Like, you don't have to want to blog. And it's a great thing to do if you really want to do it. But if you don't want to do that, that's probably going to come across in your work anyway.

**Ali** [7:18]Yeah. And going off of that, you can also just write one blog post, you don't have to change your life and become this like super, super consistent blogger overnight. Same with anything else, right, you can do something small, it doesn't mean that you have to completely transform everything and do that thing all the time. You can just do it once. And you can still help people with that.

**Emma** [7:38] We talked about this in our last episode about getting started in tech. But you need to find your why. Right? So why do you want to have this specific side project or this specific medium for expressing yourself? Right? Is it so you can learn? So for me personally, I started my blog, because I needed to learn and keep track of things for myself. And I still go back and reference my own stuff. I didn't do it for anyone else, I didn't do it to become a social media influencer, quote, unquote. I did it for myself. And I think when you do things for yourself, you're more likely to succeed, and people are more likely to see the passion in your work, and they'll want to follow you. So your goal should never be, I want to be a social media influencer, I want people to read my stuff. So no one's going to read your stuff in the beginning, you've got to be okay with that. You know, at some point, they'll show up,

**Kelly** [8:23] I also have a same.... like on that same kind of line there... you do not have to monetize your side project. You can do something entirely for fun, because as soon as you start monetizing everything, it becomes a side job instead of side project, and eventually are going to just become overwhelmed.

**Lindsey** [8:40] Yeah, no, totally. The thing with what Emma was saying, you're not going to get readers at first. I finally am starting to get some readers. And I've been doing it for about, like nine months now. And I'm finally getting a decent jump in my traffic. And it's still not as high as some people would consider successful. And for me, my goal in blogging was twofold. One to challenge myself with the accessibility more. And the other was to get developers to care more about it. And those are like, it's almost like a mission statement, which sounds really overkill, depending on how big the side project is. But because my blog is a big side project having that "why" like, I want to empower developers to do this stuff.

**Emma** [9:26] Yeah. And I think to like once you define your why. So like, if my why behind writing a blog is I want to help people learn. Define your metrics relative to that. So don't define your metrics as the number of readers. Define it as the quality. Have you helped anyone? If you've helped one person, it's worth it. So but one of the things that I think helps the success of prioritizing your side projects is doing the prep work beforehand, because we all get so excited about the fun things, right. But that means that we lack in doing the prep work. I struggle with this at work. So I work on a design team. And one of the things that I love to do is visual design and sketch, well, that's really great. But the thing is, like products aren't built starting in high fidelity. And I always, you know, regret when I don't do the foundational work to start with the wire frames and the user flows and the information architecture. I end up backtracking, and you know, shooting myself in the foot. So if you want to be successful, you've got to do the grunt work and make sure that you're organized.

**Kelly** [10:24] And not just buying a bunch of domain names.

**Ali** [10:26]Yeah, okay, here's going off is that thinking about a project that you want to do longer term, like starting a blog, with your own blog site, or a bigger code project that is open source or something along those lines, it's really fun to start stuff. When you're starting off, it's like shiny and new and fun, and you're building it up, and it's getting attention, and it's really great. So starting stuff is really easy. The hard part is continuing on with it. And I'm not perfect at that at all. I have multiple projects that are very much abandoned. But when you're thinking about things, I like to think about a year in the future, like, what is the time commitment still, then? What is the time commitment further from there? How much time do you have consistently to spend on these things? And that can really help you decide what is important to prioritize. And what is actually realistic for you to take on? Is it just something that's super one off that you can do in a night or two? Or is it something that's bigger that you can work on in a year?

**Emma** [11:29] I think too, that your your side projects should align with your ultimate career goals. So one book that I would recommend is called atomic habits. And it discusses the idea of not having finite goals, and not focusing on one, you know, finite point in time as your goal, but instead positioning yourself on a trajectory to reaching an outcome. So like, for example, if I want to have a very successful soccer team, let's say I'm a soccer coach, my goal shouldn't be to win 10 games, my goal should be to hire or to hire to have the best players on the team and build, you know, a good team dynamic, right? That's pointing out a trajectory to succeed versus, you know, if you're just focusing on this 10 winning thing, you're not positioning yourself in any sort of way to be successful. So make sure that you know your why and that you're putting yourself in the right direction. So if you want to become a senior engineer, maybe don't blog about knitting cat sweaters, you know what I mean? Like position yourself in such a way that you're you're always working towards a goal, but that's not the be all end all for, for your project.

**Lindsey** [12:30] Yeah, I totally agree with that. Because a lot of times, you know, we all get really caught up in the shiny. But to be quite frank, side projects don't always have to continue. It's okay to abandon certain projects if they no longer serve you. Like, that is totally okay. I think the biggest thing too, though, is if you want.. if you're envisioning something in the future, just knowing, like Emma said, that this is just going to take a lot of consistency. It's a habit, you know, you have to prioritize certain things. Like for me, a lot of people see what I do, but they don't see that I am not going to happy hour as often as I used to. They also don't see like some of the things that go on behind closed doors. They don't see how much I sleep. They don't see all these other things. They just see what I post on Twitter. And like I try to be very honest, on Twitter. It's not like I'm trying to post a highlight reel, but it's very much like you only see a certain factor. People always see that, "Oh, you do so much." And they don't see what you're giving up. And I think that's actually super important. When it comes to these things. I totally just went from like habits to prioritization.

**Emma** [13:37] No I love that. I love that because it's super true. Like I like, let's be real right now, I don't have a massive social life because I am an introvert to a certain extent. And so like, I don't really go to parties, or hang out with people like that sounds sad, but like it's true. Like, it's just not my personality type. I don't really watch Netflix, I am in bed by nine most nights. But like, these are the things that you give up that people don't see. And I think we've all done a pretty good job at being transparent with not just showing a highlight reel. So like, Ali and Kelly, how do you... what do you what goes on? Like what do you give up? I guess is my question. What do you sacrifice in your personal life, to be able to achieve all of these things?

**Ali** [14:19]Totally. So for me, my social life is kind of my second priority to all of this career stuff. So I do make a lot of time for my friends and going out and all that. But I definitely don't watch TV. I am so behind on cultural references that people ask me about movies, and I'm like, I legit, I have no idea what you're talking about, it's fine. And if I'm reading books, or whatever, that's usually because I'm in the car and listening to an audio book or on a plane and reading there. So I don't have a huge amount of time for a lot of other stuff like that. It's definitely a prioritization like everybody else. I'm also somebody that doesn't need a lot of downtime. So I don't need a lot of like time by myself, just chillin and doing nothing. For me, it's social time, dog time, work time. That's mostly it. And then also, I'm pretty lucky that I'm somebody that relies on not a huge amount of sleep, so can kind of cut down on those hours to sorry, don't take that as advice.

**Kelly** [15:24] I also don't require that much sleep,

**Emma** [15:26] y'all unsolicited advice is never a good idea. I sleep for 12 hours a night. I'm also part bear.

**Ali** [15:36]so impressive. I did four hours for forever, like all through the end of high school through college and my first couple years of my career. And now I'm doing like six ish. And so I feel like I'm making moves in the healthier direction, but definitely have not always been that way.

**Lindsey** [15:53] I'm going to interrupt before Kelly starts talking. Because I don't know how that happens. I got five to six hours last week, and I was a hot mess this weekend.

**Ali** [16:05]There was an article a while ago about how different people have different genetic sleeping patterns that they need to uphold. And so it's just different for everybody and know yourself. Don't say that "Ali sleeps four hours a night. I'm only going to do that." But yeah, know what's good for you and what you need.

**Lindsey** [16:23] Yeah, totally. I think that's actually pretty important to note is we're all different. All four of us are very different personalities. And we have different needs. I know for me, I do need social time. I don't need as much as I used to, but I am definitely an extrovert. I need that social time. And if I don't get it... like I noticed, it's a lot different when my partner is traveling for work. I noticed though after like three days, I'm like really depressed because I'm super lonely. It's definitely good to know yourself, know your thresholds, know your thresholds with sleep, know what you need.

**Emma** [16:59] I also really quickly before I let you like actually talk, Kelly.

**Kelly** [17:04] Okay, I'm not here.

**Emma** [17:05] I want to point out too, that this stuff ebbs and flows, like, this is not something I never forced myself to work if I'm not in a good mental space, or if I'm tired. So like, often, I'll be super productive for like two days straight. And then I won't do anything for like the last five days of the week, right? So you can try to set a finite schedule for yourself. But like, my advice is don't push yourself if you're not feeling it, as long as you don't have a deadline, obviously, because that's how you burn out. So I guess with that, Kelly, I will let you talk now.

**Kelly** [17:39] Thank you. Awesome. Yeah. Okay, so kind of combining. I have a lot of thoughts of what happened here, but I didn't write any of them down. So here we go. It's also really helpful to have somebody be able to keep you in check if possible. My husband is really good at that. So we go to a coffee shop pretty much every Saturday and every Sunday morning. It's the same coffee shop. I love you Chattahoochee Coffee on the west side, if you're in Atlanta, please go to it. He kind of like cuts me off, my husband cuts me off about like noon and be like, "All right, you've worked for long enough. Let's go do something else." But I use that as my as my time management for, you know, working on these side projects. And something else that I want to do when I obviously have actual work to do during the day. And that's I found that's been that's been really helpful.

**Lindsey** [18:25] Having even if it's like just a friend or a roommate or anything, if you're struggling with your own boundaries, have somebody who will call you out. Somebody who will help enforce that boundary. Boundaries are super hard. Even though I think I have very good boundaries, I still suck at them. Like my boundaries are either really good or crap.

**Kelly** [18:45] Awesome. Let's move towards talking about what has worked best for you as far as taking breaks and scheduling. You know, when you're actually working on this? Do you have a certain technique you'd like to follow for your side projects?

**Emma** [18:58] How do I schedule break? To be perfectly frank, I'm really bad about this. I burn out a lot, I feel like for multiple reasons. I would say social media is one of them. Because I don't know about all of you. But social media for me is also a part time job. And so I burn out very, very easily. And I am bad at taking breaks. Because I feel like when I take breaks, I am wasting time. And that's really hard for me to overcome mentally, and so I've been trying to be better about like, if I'm tired, or I'm not feeling it, I'm not going to work. So I wouldn't say that I scheduled them. But I'm trying to be better about reading my own, you know, my own emotions and whatnot, to not force myself into these things.

**Ali** [19:37]I do have calendar blocking. So I pull up my Google calendar for usually a week at a time. And I schedule like every single minute on it, including breaks. So I'll schedule my wake up, I'll schedule my work for my company, I will do side stuff, I will do my workout. Everything is on that calendar, if I want to watch it TV show that's on there, too. And so I know that I'm getting everything that I want done. Because if a goal doesn't have a time on a calendar, it's just a goal. It's not something that actually has time prioritize for it. So I try to do that in order to get everything on the calendar. I don't stick to it perfectly by any means. But it's nice to have some sort of guideline of this is what I'm supposed to be doing now.

**Emma** [20:22] You're making it actionable.

**Kelly** [20:24] I am the exact opposite of Ali. I only have my meetings on my calendar. And that is literally it. I've learned from my own experience that if I forced myself into these these box times, I just get frustrated seeing my calendar. So it doesn't it doesn't work for me. And again, you know, these different techniques are going to be different for everybody. I'm more of somebody who would rather be like, Oh, well, I don't really feel like working on this anymore. So I'm going to switch gears I need I need a brain break.

**Emma** [20:51] I think that's really interesting. Because when you take a look at all of our different styles it's like polar opposites. And that should go to show you that there's no one answer to this question. How do you get so much done? I think it all depends on you and your personal style. So maybe you're like Ali and you schedule everything down to a tee or maybe you're like Kelly and partially myself. I'm like a hybrid, but like, you know, the only scheduled meetings and let yourself run free. So So yeah, no one solution to this problem. So

**Lindsey** [21:22] With that, too. I think I'm also a hybrid. I used to be very good about scheduling myself. And I think I kind of need to get back on to that, because I've been sort of going with the flow for a little bit. But now that I have a little bit more on my plate, I really want to start prioritizing better. Because I am a free spirit, I will go all over the place. And I'm a free spirit who's also type A, which does not go very hand in hand. So I kind of I need to keep myself in check a little bit more. But sometimes they do notice that I need a little bit more of that freedom

**Emma** [21:53] Something that just kind of popped into my mind is the fact that with side projects, you don't necessarily need to wear a developer hat. If you you're gonna have a side project, this is a cool opportunity to branch outside of your comfort zone and maybe take on like a design role or a project manager role. So like when I started my open source project, the first thing my husband said to me was like, you know, you're not allowed to code any of this, right? And I was like, What are you talking about? I'm going to write all the code. And he was like, this project needs someone to run it where it's going to fail. And I'm like, Okay, well, that's true. So like on one of my side projects, all I do is product manage and design. So they're really great way for you to take on new roles and maybe even get your feet wet in areas you might not have thought that you would be interested in delving into

**Ali** [22:32]Yeah, most of my side work comes to the teaching realm and my heart is so in teaching that it feels more fulfilling than a job. So I totally relate to that and not doing writing code all the time.

**Lindsey** [22:45] Honestly, once I launched my blog, very little of it is coding. Sometimes there's code samples, but even then, like it's mostly just doing things I've already done before and copying and pasting, and just double checking that it works.

**Emma** [23:01] Cool. I think with that, let's jump into something really cool, which is an idea that I hadn't really thought about until Ali mentioned the other day, which is batching. So what is this concept of batching Ali?

**Ali** [23:12]Yeah, so doing similar tasks all together, because your mind is already in that one space. So if you keep going, and I think direction, you can be more productive. So something that I do, for example, is a little behind the scenes look at my social media, but for example, Instagram, right? I try to spend as little time as possible, because I would rather focus on other things. And so I will make like a month of Instagram content all in one hour or so. So I'll make my infographics and edit my pictures and all that and just line it all up at once because if I'm already in that mind space, I'm already in sketch, I'm already moving stuff around and have those templates up, might as well just do a bunch at once. And so then I don't have to think about it again. I tried to do that with outlining blog posts, and whatever else I can do, I've tried to batch it.

**Lindsey** [24:04] Yeah, I've been wanting to do that for so long. And I just I know it's going to be better for me and I keep on not doing it.

**Emma** [24:11] We should do that with emails, right? We talked about starting with the biggest task first or eat the biggest frog first, emails are super insignificant in the in the realm of things. The world's not going to explode if you don't respond within 15 minutes, unless you're in a support role, which maybe don't do that. So I would suggest batching your emails, the beginning and the end of the day, it'll save a ton of time and you'll be much more productive.

**Lindsey** [24:32] I think something I've always been wanting to do is batch my blog posts and write like three blog posts at once. But I haven't done that yet. I need to do that.

**Kelly** [24:41] And when you're when you're batching something creative, it's so useful because you know, if you're on this like real good train of thought you're like I get it, I can push out all this content here. And then the next day or, or next week or whatever, you try to go sit down or write something like I have nothing, you know that you have some content to back you up. So you can just focus your efforts on something that's going to be a little bit more productive for you know, your current state of mind.

**Emma** [25:04] I mean, to be honest, I batch my tweets, like there are there are days when I'm super funny. Like I just sit there and I giggle at all the stuff in my mind. No, but there are days where I'm like, Oh, I'm really funny today. And then like write it write a bunch of tweets. And I'm like, I can't like triple tweet. So I'll just like save it to draft and that way if I'm like, not as funny one day, I'm like, Okay, let's go to draft. Let's see what we've got. And like, honestly, I think that helps. Because when you're not in the right mind space, or like if you're not feeling like, you know, emotionally secure or whatnot like you, again, like you just said, Kelly, you have that fallback

**Ali** [25:34]Totally I do that, too.

**Lindsey** [25:35] And the nice thing too with that is like you were in a headspace when you were thinking of it, but sometimes I have like these ideas. And I'm like, Oh, this is a great tweet, or this is really funny, or whatever. And I'm like, but nobody's going to see it because it's two in the morning. So I'll just schedule it for the morning.

**Kelly** [25:47] And it's also really useful when you make a lot of jokes on Twitter. And then you look through your draft's the next morning, you're like, wow, Kelly, that was really bad. Then I save everybody the trouble from having to read that.

**Emma** [26:03] Super true. I would love to see like your graveyard of dead drafts though.

**Ali** [26:07]Oh, my goodness, mine would all be like overly sappy. I always read those and then delete them. Like, this is too gushy.

**Emma** [26:16] I love that.

**Lindsey** [26:19] I love gushy statuses.

**Emma** [26:20] One last thing I'd love to touch on and this problem spaces, small wins, because I feel like we take them for granted. So not only should we track our wins, or you know, our successes, no matter how small they are, but like track them so that when you're having a bad day, like you can go back and be like, Oh, I answered an email today. You know, I'm kidding. But like having that list to refer back to like, it adds up, right atomic habits they build to be something more composite

**Ali** [26:45]Totally agree. That's what I mostly, for code projects, do small stuff that I can crank out in like a night or two, because then it's done. And I don't have to keep thinking about it. And I don't have to keep allocating time or giving mental space to it. I just get it done. And it feels like a win. And it's exciting.

**Lindsey** [27:03] And it just also like Kelly can correct me on this. But I'm like, I feel like that's also how human psychology works. Right? We we have small wins. And you know, when we check something off the list or even just just accomplish something, even if it's small, you still have that positive hormone or whatever. I don't know the science behind it, but I'm gonna let Miss Social Work master degree correct me if I'm wrong.

**Kelly** [27:23] Yeah, I was gonna say, you know, the reason why Lindsey mentioned I might be able to speak on it is because my, my bachelor's degree is in psychology. And I have two masters degrees in public health and clinical social work. So I know a little bit about this. I think we tend to ignore the small wins, because we have our sights set so far away. And if we're not focusing on the small successes that we're making along the way, that end goal can be very daunting. And you can just, you know, get into this really negative headspace that you're not actually making any progress when you really are. And that's why, you know, I always tell people, like, it's so important to write everything down that you have accomplished. I literally have a folder on my computer that I've taken screenshots of, you know, just the way that people have responded to be like really polite, you know, compliments that I've received. Just so I can look back at those some days where I'm just like, not having a great day trying to figure out something to do with my business, because that's what happens when you're trying to figure out as you go, and you're running a business, and just looking at those small successes. It's just it's really helpful to kind of put you back into a more positive headspace.

**Emma** [28:29] Yeah, for instance. Now today, I feel like I don't know JavaScript, it's too hard. There's so many nuances of the scripting language, right. But then I look back at myself four years ago, and I'm like, I didn't even know how to import a JavaScript file into HTML. When you compare these quote, unquote, like, small wins to where you were years ago, oh, they add up.

**Lindsey** [28:51] And something that you also this is more career tip in a positive mindset [tip] is write those down and give them to your boss. Come review time, give them give your boss that list, and be like, Hey, give me more money, or a raise, or that's what giving more money is...is a raise. I mean, a promotion?

**Kelly** [29:14] No, there's also a bonus.

**Emma** [29:16] So like, when when you want to ask for a promotion, or a raise, you know, whatnot, you need to have that archive to back it up. Because at the end of the day, they need to bring it to their boss. And if they if you've done the heavy lifting, it makes them a heck of a lot more likely to recommend you. Right?

**Ali** [29:34]Yeah, I got a 50% raise by doing that. So

**Emma** [29:36] yeah, holy cow. We need to talk about raises.

**Kelly** [29:38] You're making you're making what \$12 now?

**Ali** [29:41]yeah, yeah. All the money. This is an old job. Tracking the wins. Hundred percent. Yeah.

**Emma** [29:52] So. So now that we've covered our small wins or doing small things that you can check off. Let's first of all mentioned the fact that this podcast is a side project, which is really cool and ironic, because you know, we're talking about side projects. Is that Inception or recursion or... Anyway, there's no base case. So given the fact of this podcast as a side project, I would say the culmination of our win today is the fact that we've gotten an immense amount of support from the community. So we've officially surpassed 1000 Twitter followers in five hours. Is that a record? Yeah, that's not a small

**Lindsey** [30:29] It's a record for me!

**Kelly** [30:30] I mean, I've never gotten that many followers in an hour.

**Lindsey** [30:33] Right. That's amazing.

**Emma** [30:34] Amazing. So we need to celebrate ourselves. Because, you know, we appreciate the support that the community has given us. But um, is that the only one we want to cover? Does anyone else have anything else they would like to share?

**Lindsey** [30:44] Honestly, I think it's so fitting for this episode, because all of us have been working really hard on it. And it's so nice to see the fruits of our labor come and have so much support behind us.

**Kelly** [30:57] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

**Ali** [30:58]Yeah, for sure. This has been really, really cool.

**Lindsey** [31:01] Well, let's leave it on that positive note, because this is super awesome.

**Emma** [31:05] Absolutely. So we want to thank y'all for being here for listening. And make sure to, as the youtubers would say, "smash that like" and "leave a comment below" and "subscribe." Don't know any of this works. But like all the things, and thank you all for being here.

**Ali** [31:23]Five stars and positive reviews if you liked it.

**Emma** [31:26] Yeah. And if you didn't like it, you cannot leave a review to

**Ali** [31:29]leave DM's with the "hi" so we can ignore it. Okay, just kidding. Just kidding. Just kidding. Obviously, what your feedback.

**Lindsey** [31:41] Awesome,

**Ali** [31:41]Even if it's not so good.

**Emma** [31:42] We're all hungry. It's fine. Forget it. Okay.

**Lindsey** [31:44] Well, anyway, everybody, have a good day. Super awesome to talk to you.
